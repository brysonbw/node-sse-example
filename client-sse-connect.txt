1. can use browser EventSource lib to connect to server and listen to events
let sse = new EventSource('http://localhost:5000/stream');
sse.onmessage = console.log

restablishes connection when server dies

However, organically it will restart but not from where it left off

NOTE ^
So, you must design the event so it can log or keep track of the event for which it sent
